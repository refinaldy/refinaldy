# Hi, I'm Refinaldy.

I’ve always believed that building software shouldn't be a headache.

That’s why I position myself as a **Product Engineer** <br>
Somewhere between **managing the product roadmap** and **leading the technical implementation**.

We are living in a time where AI is changing how we code. So, a big part of my work now is figuring out how to use those tools to make developer workflows faster and.. honestly, a lot less painful.

> ☕️ **Because at the end of the day, we all just want to ship cool stuff and actually enjoy our weekends.** <br>
> _Or at least, that's the plan. No promises_ ✌️
